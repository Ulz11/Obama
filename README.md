This is a real-time converter that transforms text between Latin (English) alphabet and Cyrillic script, specifically designed for Mongolian language users. Here's how it works:
The user types in Latin letters, using the familiar QWERTY keyboard layout that most people are comfortable with. As they type, the system instantly converts these Latin characters into their corresponding Cyrillic letters following Mongolian language rules. This eliminates the need to hunt for the correct Cyrillic keys on the keyboard or memorize a new keyboard layout.
For example, if someone wants to write the Mongolian word "сайн" (meaning "good"), instead of struggling with Cyrillic input, they could simply type "sain" using Latin letters, and the converter would automatically display "сайн" in Cyrillic.

1. People who grew up using primarily Latin-script keyboards
2. Users who haven't mastered the Cyrillic keyboard layout
3. Those who need to type quickly and can't afford the slowdown of searching for Cyrillic characters
4. Individuals who regularly switch between Latin and Cyrillic typing
